Description: The age is estimated by calculating the Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) on the whole auricular surface and the apex of the auricular surface. It involves three estimation methods: principal component discriminant analysis (PCQDA), and principal component logistic regression analysis (PCLR) methods, principal component regression analysis with Southeast Asian (A_PCR), and principal component regression analysis with multipopulation (M_PCR). The package is created with the data from the Louis Lopes Collection in Lisbon, the 21st Century Identified Human Remains Collection in Coimbra, and the CAL Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection in Milan, and  the skeletal collection at Khon Kaen University (KKU) Human Skeletal Research Centre (HSRC), housed in the Department of Anatomy in the Faculty of Medicine at KKU in Khon Kaen.
