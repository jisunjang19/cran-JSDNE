### Abstract

Age estimation plays a significant role in forensic anthropology and bioarchaeology. However, widely-used traditional methods involving macroscopic observation suffer from subjectivity and statistical bias. The present research aims to minimize both issues by applying computational and mathematical approaches. A laser scanner was used to reconstruct 890 auricular surfaces of adult individuals from three known-age European skeletal collections. Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) was applied to assess the curvature of the auricular surface and its relationship with known age-at-death. Ten variables had high correlations, including total DNE per Total polygon faces, Mean value of DNE on apex, proportion of polygon faces with DNE of less than 0.0001 and proportion of polygon faces with DNE of over 0.6. The variables were used to develop age prediction models which are freely available in a novel R package, JSDNE. The package predicts age mathematically, objectively, and user-independently. It includes five functions: principal component quadratic discriminant analysis (PCQDA),principal component regression analysis (PCR), principal component logistic regression analysis with European (PCLR), principal component logistic regression analysis with Southeast Asian (A_PCLR), and principal component logistic regression analysis with multi-population (M_PCLR). JSDNE predicts age mathematically, objectively, and user-independently. The PCQDA function involves four age phases: phase 1(22-44yrs), phase 2(31-74yrs), phase 3(63-93yrs), and phase 4 (Over 76). The PCLR function has two age phases: phase 1 (under 67), phase 2(over 63)). It offers an output of estimated age phase and the age range. Both functions provides an output of estimated age phase and the age range. The PCR, A_PCR, and M_PCR functions provide an output of estimated age in years and the standard error (8.8yrs, 9.0 yrs, and 10.2 yrs, respectively). JSDNE package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=JSDNE) can be downloaded automatically using install.packages("JSDNE"). The detailed code and the raw data developed the findings of this study are openly available at https://github.com/jisunjang19/cran-JSDNE or doi: 10.5281/zenodo.12708779.

### Introduction

Age estimation, together with sex and stature estimation, is crucial in constructing the biological profile of human remains. In bioarchaeology, the biological profile is the foundation for reconstructing past demographic information, leading to the proper understanding of human life history. Forensic anthropology uses the biological profile to identify unknown individuals, helping to investigate cases of missing persons, mass disasters, genocide, and violent crime (Márquez-Grant, 2015; Moraitis et al., 2014; Rissech et al., 2012). With increased globalisation, natural disasters, and international terrorism, attention has been paid to developing more accurate and objective age estimation methods (Zhang et al., 2022). 
	Age estimation methods have been developed based on observing bone changes that occur throughout life (Byers, 2007). These bone changes can be divided into developmental and degenerative changes (Moraitis et al., 2014); developmental changes are based on the maturation rate of bones, such as epiphyseal ossification (Schmeling et al., 2004), and tooth eruption (Kumar and Sridhar, 1990). These are used to estimate subadult age. As for adults who have completed growth, age is estimated by examining the degree of degenerative change (Schwartz, 1995), including the pubic symphysis (Brooks and Suchey, 1990), the sternal ends of the ribs (Işcan et al., 1984), and the auricular surface (Lovejoy et al., 1985). Among these, the auricular surface is considered one of the most significant indicators as it is dense, highly durable and often well-preserved against decomposition (Rivera-Sandoval et al., 2018). Moreover, it is argued that degenerative changes on the auricular surface continue after 60 years of age, making it possible to estimate older adults' age more accurately than other age indicators (Rissech et al., 2012). Even though age estimation methods have been developed and revised over several decades, there is still no way to precisely interpret the speed and degree of change for different individuals. This is because bone changes are affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as genes, diet, socioeconomics, and activity throughout the life, with rates of change varying between individuals. Therefore, estimating adult age can be complicated and inaccurate (Miranker, 2016). Age estimation methods traditionally suffer from two common issues: subjectivity and statistical bias. 
Most age estimation methods are based on visual assessment, which increases subjectivity. When assessing degenerative changes observers rely on their own expertise and experience to interpret the morphological features. Thus, the interpretation can differ depending on the observer, and the estimated result also varies. Even if the same observer assesses the same bone on different occasions, the results can be different. These are called interobserver and intraobserver errors, respectively (Garvin and Passalqua, 2011; Moraitis et al., 2014). Statistical bias occurs due to differences in the age structure of the reference and target samples. Fundamentally, the estimated results for a target sample can be biased by the spread of ages of individuals that made up the reference sample. This is known as age structure mimicry (Mensforth, 1990:90). Regional and diachronic variations can also influence the degree of degeneration displayed by different morphological features, biasing results towards the reference sample and causing inaccurate and unreliable results. Overall, these issues impact the accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and repeatability of results. To address these limitations, more objective and less observer-dependent age estimation methods have been sought (Botha et al., 2019; Curate et al., 2022).
Recently, virtual anthropology has gained attention due to its potential to improve and revise traditional approaches through the application of computational imaging technology, such as computed tomography and laser scanning (Warrier et al., 2023). This allows a mathematical approach to extract subtle surface changes and more complex visual information not limited by human vision (Zhang et al., 2022; Warrier et al., 2023). It is also more user-independent, so the extracted results are objective, reproducible, and repeatable (Zhang et al., 2022). Currently, the most widely used mathematical approach in age estimation is curvature analysis of the joint surface. Curvature analysis is used to evaluate the degree to which surfaces are undulated or flat, and can therefore be used to analyse surface texture irregularities (Villa et al., 2015). To date, most research has focused on the pubic symphysis (Biwasaka et al., 2013; Stoyanova et al., 2015; Stoyanova et al., 2017; Slice and Agee-Hewitt, 2015), with only three papers exploring curvature analysis on the auricular surface (Jang et al., 2024; Štepanovský et al., 2023; Villa et al., 2015). Villa et al. (2015) used Gaussian curvature analysis to examine the correlations between five curvature variables and age: mean, highest, lowest, convex, and flat curvatures. The variables had moderate correlations with age, though it was noted that both young and older adults displayed high curvature values; young individuals because of transverse organisation, and older individuals due to increased macroporosity. Middle-aged individuals, who generally showed no transverse organisation or macroporosity (reflecting a flatter auricular surface), had lower curvature values. However, due to the sensitivity limitations of the equipment, detailed surface features such as surface texture and microporosity could not be analysed (Villa et al., 2015). While Villa et al. (2015) were able to show a correlation between curvature values and adult age, Štepanovský et al. (2023) developed this method further to produce age estimation software, CoxAGE3D, which uses an automatic data mining model. CoxAGE3D is fully automated, with age estimations produced after the user uploads a 3D laser scan of an auricular surface to the program. Calculations are based on multi-population auricular surfaces from five known-age Asian and European collections, reducing statistical bias levels. While this method appears to be able to identify a number of age-related coefficients, accuracy rates were not provided and it is yet to be subjected to independent validation. 
Jang et al. (2024) examined age-related change to the auricular surface using a different type of curvature analysis, Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE). This requires a surface to be converted into polygon faces before DNE is used to measure how much the surface bends, which it does by quantifying the deviation of surface energy from a stable state, which is 0 or flat. Each polygon face (ρ) has two principal curvatures: the largest curvature (v) and the smallest curvature (υ), and the points at which these meet are called vertices (Figure 1). Each vertex has a normal (red arrow), which is the average value of the adjacent polygonal normal vectors (blue arrows). A polygon is formed by translating the normal vectors to a common vertex. This polygon has edge vectors (nν and nυ), which are derivatives of v and υ (Bunn et al., 2011; Pampush et al., 2016; Winchester, 2016). The Dirichlet Energy Density (DED) is obtained from the sum of square roots of edge vectors. Then, DNE is calculated as the total sum of the values multiplied by DNE and area (Pampush et al., 2016:398):


$$DED(\rho)=(n_v)^2(n_u)^2$$ $$DNE=\sum DED(\rho) \times area(\rho)$$

This makes it possible to identify subtle changes in surface curvature
more sensitively than other methods of curvature analysis (Bunn et al.,
2011; Godfrey et al., 2012). As Jang et al. (2024) tested this method on
archaeological skeletons with no biological information, age was
estimated using the Lovejoy (1985) and Buckberry-Chamberlain (2002)
methods. It was found that four DNE variables correlated with the
estimated age phases, those relating to surface undulation, apical
activity, macroporosity, and the total DNE per total number of polygon
faces. In terms of total DNE per total number of polygon faces, younger
adults had higher values than middle-aged adults due to the presence of
transverse organisation (surface undulation), which occurred more
frequently in the former. Younger adults had the highest DNE values for
surface undulation, with these values falling with increasing age.
Middle-aged adults had lower total DNE values because, as initially
noted by Villa et al. (2015), their auricular surfaces were flatter due
to a lack of transverse organisation or macroporosity. Older adults had
the highest total DNE values and the highest DNE values for
macroporosity and apical activity, which both showed a positive
correlation with age phase (Jang et al., 2024). Jang et al. (2024)
tested the levels of intraobserver error associated with this method and
found very high levels of agreement. However, there was still a degree
of user dependency as the user must manually select a region of interest
(ROI) before DNE values can be calculated (Jang et al., 2024). Moreover,
as this study used archaeological skeletons, the age of the individuals
was not documented, potentially obscuring relationships between DNE
values and age at death. To address these limitations, the current paper
builds on the work of Jang et al. (2024) by reducing the need to select
a ROI manually, and examining the relationship between DNE values and
age-at-death in known-age individuals. Age-related variables will be
identified via five statistical analysis methods: principal component
discriminant analysis (PCQDA), principal component logistic regression analysis (PCLR), principal component regression analysis (PCR), principal component regression analysis with Southeast Asian (PCR), and principal component regression analysis with multi-population (PCR). The results have been used to develop an R package, JSDNE, which can be used to estimate age-at-death in unknown individuals.

### Materials

Data was collected from four European and Southeast Asian anatomical skeletal 
collections; the Luís Lopes Skeletal Collection, the 21st Century Identified 
Skeletal Collection, the CAL Milano Cemetery Skeletal Collection, and the skeletal collection at Khon Kaen University (KKU) Human Skeletal Research Centre (HSRC).

The Luís Lopes Skeletal Collection is curated by the National Museum of Natural History 
and Science (MUHNAC), Lisbon, Portugal.It contains 1,692 skeletons in total, with biographical
information available for 699 individuals, including age-at-death, place
of birth and residence, and cause of death. The remains were collected
from a modern cemetery in Lisbon between 19th and 20th centuries
(Cardoso, 2006). The 21st Century Identified Skeletal Collection is
curated by the University of Coimbra, Portugal. This contained 159 adult
individuals, ranging in age from 29 to 99 years at death. Most
individuals were Portuguese, dying between 1995 and 2008. Biographical
information, including sex and age-at-death, is available for the entire
collection, with documentation relating to the cause of death available
for 12 individuals (Ferreira et al., 2014). The CAL Milano
Cemetery Skeletal Collection is curated by the Laboratorio di
Antropologia e Odontologia Forense (LABANOF) in the Department of
Biomedical Sciences for Health of the University of Milan (Italy) and
part of the Collezione Antropologica LABANOF (CAL), Italy. It contains
2127 skeletons from Cimitero Maggiore, Cimitero di Lambrate, and
Cimitero di Baggio. Biographical information, such as sex, age-at-death,
date of birth and death, cause of death, and pathology (if it is
specified), were all documented. The individuals died between 1910 and
2001, but most of them died after 1980 (Cattaneo et al., 2018). Lastly, the skeletal collection at Khon Kaen University (KKU) Human Skeletal Research Centre (HSRC) is housed in the Department of Anatomy in the Faculty of Medicine at KKU in Thailand. It is the largest skeletal research collection in Southeast Asia. The collection consists of 742 individuals who lived and died from the 20th to the 21st century, with biological information. 97.1% (n=683) of individuals (216 females and 466 males) are known age-at-death. The majority of individuals were aged over 60 years. The oldest individual was recorded at 109 years old (Techataweewan et al., 2017). All adult individuals used in current study had fully preserved auricular surfaces that displayed no taphonomic damage or pathological conditions.

### Methods

Preparation and importing of reconstructed models Auricular surfaces
were scanned using an EXScan SP laser scanner (resolution: 1.3
megapixels). Each surface was scanned from a minimum of five different
angles and the resultant images were combined using the software
EXScanS_v3.1.0.1 to produce a single 3D model which was saved as a .ply
file. Each .ply file was then edited manually in Meshmixer to produce
two ROIs; the auricular surface and the apical area. The auricular
surface was isolated using the outer margin as a guide (following the
criterion of Jang et al., 2024). The apical area was delineated by
measuring polygons within a 1cm distance from both the left and right
sides of the terminated point of the arcuate line. The 3D models were
imported into R studio with the vcgPlyRead function from Rvcg package
(Schlager, 2015).

Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA, A_PCR, and M_PCR), quadratic discriminant
analysis (PCDQA), and regression analysis (PCLR) were used to identify
DNE variables that were highly correlated with known age-at-death. These
correlations were then used to develop a model that estimates an unknown
auricular surface's age-at-death. In order to make this model available
to other researchers, an R package, JSDNE, was created, which requires R
version 4.3.2 (R Core Team, 2024). JSDNE can be installed automatically
by operating the install function, install.packages("JSDNE"). Once the
package is installed, it can be imported by the library function,
library(JSDNE). Four packages are automatically imported to the user's
library: dplyr (Wickham et al., 2019), MASS (Venables and Ripley, 2002),
molaR (Pampush et al., 2016), and nnet (Venables and Ripley, 2002).
After importing the .ply files with the vcgPlyRead function, the
auricular surface .ply file should be replaced with x and the apical
area with y. If oppositely applied, incorrect results will be
calculated. The JSDNE package consists of three functions to estimate
age. The PCQDA function can assign an individual to one of
four broad age ranges: phase 1 (20-44yrs), phase 2(31-74yrs), phase 3 (63-93yrs), phase 4 (over 76). The PCLR function also assigns an individual to a broad age range, but with a more limited
range of under 67 years (phase 1) or over 63 years (phase 2).The PCR function provides an output of
estimated age in years and the standard error (PCR:8.8yrs, A_PCR:9.0yrs, and M_PCR:10.2yrs)


### Results

Age-related variables Initial analyses identified ten DNE variables that
were highly correlated with age-at-death in the known-age sample. Nine of 
these variables (total DNE per total number of
polygon faces, median value of DNE on whole surface, interquartile range
(IQR) on whole surface, mean value of DNE on convex and concave
surfaces, proportion of polygon faces with DNE of over 0.6, and mean,
median and IQR of DNE on apex) had high positive correlations, while the
proportion of polygon faces with DNE of less than 0.0001, had a high
negative correlation.

Identifying the suitable variables and the cluster The best combination
of variables was chosen on the basis of three criteria: (1) high total
accuracy, (2) high accuracy in younger auricular surfaces and older
auricular surfaces, and (3) low bias. For PCR analysis, an additional
criterion was used: low standard error. In the PCQDA analysis, Grouping 
estimated ages into four age phases. The age intervals of each phase are 
24 years (phase 1), 43 years (phase 2) and 30 years (phase 3), with an 
open-ended phase 4. In the PCLR analysis, estimated age was divided into 
two phases to determine if the auricular surface is under 67 years or over 
63 years. In PCR, A_PCR, and M_PCR analyses, these are a regression model 
no age phase was produced. Instead, the output provides an estimated age in 
years with a standard error of ±8.8yrs, ±9.0yrs, and ±10.2yrs. 
The age phases for each of the three types of analysis were
designated in order of the lowest minimum value of the age range. The
minimum values of age phases 1,2,3 and 4 in PCQDA were 20,31,63 and 76,
respectively, and minimum values of age phases 1 and 2 in PCLR were 20
and 63, respectively. When converting the variables to principal
components, the first and second principal components contained 98%,
96%, and 96% information in PCQDA, PCLR, and PCR methods, respectively.
Thus, the first and second principal components were used as variables.
Then, the statistical models were developed using cross-validation. The
training and test sets contained 80% and 20% of the data set randomly.


### Accuracy, bias, and the average absolute deviation

The training set, test set, and combined set showed similar
results. Accordingly, the results were described based on the combined
set. Accuracy was defined as JSDNE age estimates that fell within the
age phase that contained the known age-at-death. Bias was calculated as
the mean value of the subtracted values between the mean age of the
estimated age phase and the known age at death. The average absolute
deviation (AAD) was the mean value of the absolute values subtracted
between the mean age of the estimated age phase and the known age at
death:

$$Bias=\sum(mean \ age \ of \ the \ estimated \ age \ phase - known \ age \ at \ death)/N$$
$$AAD=\sum|mean \ age \ of \ the \ estimated \ age \ phase - known \ age \ at \ death|/N$$

### Summary of the Results of PCQDA model with Euroepan sample

The total accuracy and the average absolute deviation (AAD) are 91% and 9.58 years, respectively. This demonstrates that the PCQDA function estimates age with a high level of accuracy and precision. Phase 2, which estimated individuals to be over 31 and under 74 years of age, had the lowest accuracy (88.8%) and the highest AAD (11.52 years). The highest accuracy and the lowest AAD were shown in phase 1 (20-44 years of age), with 97.8% and 5.53 years, respectively. While the cluster analysis identified this four-phase grouping system as the best fit for the prediction model, levels of accuracy were also examined using 10-year age intervals, in order to compare the relative applicability of each of the functions across age cohorts. This showed that there was a tendency to underestimate the age of older individuals (those in their 60s and older) and overestimate the age of younger and middle aged individuals (in their 50s and younger). Individuals in their 20s were estimated with the lowest level of accuracy (65.9%). The highest AAD (94.9 years) was in their 30s. The highest accuracy levels were seen for individuals estimated to be in their 40s (98.2%).

### Summary of the Results of PCLR model with Euroepan sample

Accuracy was defined as JSDNE age estimates that fell within the age phase that contained the known age-at-death. PCLR produced a high level of accuracy overall (92.9%), and high precision (9.93 years). Phase 1 has higher accuracy (95.2%) than phase 2 (90.2%). However, phase 2 has higher precision than phase 1, indicated by the lower AAD value (11.48 years vs. 8.09 years). When classifying individuals with 10-year age intervals, the highest accuracy was shown for individuals in their 30s (100%), and the lowest accuracy for individuals in their 60s (80.6%). In terms of precision, individuals in 20s had the lowest precision (ADD: 20.45 years), and those in their 40s had the highest precision (ADD: 2.68 years). Yet again, individuals under 40 years of age tended to be overestimated, while individuals over 40 were underestimated.

### Summary of the Results of PCR model with Euroepan sample

PCR Accuracy was defined as JSDNE age estimates that fell within the standard error (8.8yrs) of the known age-at-death. The total accuracy and ADD are 76% and 6.46 years, respectively. When collated into 10-year age intervals, the accuracy levels range from poor to moderate, but this is due to the high precision of the age estimate in the majority of intervals. Individuals in their 20s and over 80 were predicted with the lowest levels of accuracy (52.4% and 56.3%), and highest levels of AAD (9.37 years and 9.4 years). The highest accuracy (92.2%) was found for individuals estimated to be in their 50s. As with the PCQDA function, there was a tendency for younger and middle aged adults (those in their 40s and younger) to be overestimated, while the age of individuals over 50 was underestimated.


### Summary of the Results of A_PCR model with Southeast sample

A_PCR Accuracy was defined as JSDNE age estimates that fell within the standard error (9.0yrs) of the known age-at-death. The total accuracy and ADD are 69% and 7.0 years, respectively. When collated into 10-year age intervals, the accuracy levels range from poor to moderate, but this is due to the high precision of the age estimate in the majority of intervals. Individuals in their 20s and over 80 were predicted with the lowest levels of accuracy (60% and 50%), and highest levels of AAD (9.5 years and 9.7 years). The highest accuracy (78%) was found for individuals estimated to be in their 50s. As with the PCQDA function, there was a tendency for younger and middle aged adults (those in their 40s and younger) to be overestimated, while the age of individuals over 60 was underestimated.

### Summary of the Results of M_PCR model with Multipopulational samples

A_PCR Accuracy was defined as JSDNE age estimates that fell within the standard error (9.0yrs) of the known age-at-death. The Southeast Asian sample was used. The total accuracy and ADD are 69% and 7.0 years, respectively. When collated into 10-year age intervals, the accuracy levels range from poor to moderate, but this is due to the high precision of the age estimate in the majority of intervals. Individuals in their 20s and over 80 were predicted with the lowest levels of accuracy (60% and 50%), and highest levels of AAD (9.5 years and 9.7 years). The highest accuracy (78%) was found for individuals estimated to be in their 50s. As with the PCQDA function, there was a tendency for younger and middle aged adults (those in their 40s and younger) to be overestimated, while the age of individuals over 60 was underestimated.

### Conclusion

The present research successfully identified ten geometric variables of the auricular surface that were associated with known age-at-death and used these to create an objective, mathematical age estimation method that is available as a novel R package, JSDNE (https://cran.r-project.org/package=JSDNE). The detailed code and the raw data developed the findings of this study are openly available at https://github.com/jisunjang19/cran-JSDNE or doi: 10.5281/zenodo.12708779. This estimates age using five functions which offers the moderate to high levels of accuracy (69-92.9%). This method does not require a great degree of experience to gather and interpret the results, only familiarity with R studio and access to a laser scanner. Moreover, the results can be applied to research in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology.

### Code Summary
#### `PCQDA_result()`

PCQDA method involves four age phases: age phase 1 (age range:20-44), age phase 2 (age range:31-74), age phase 3 (age range:63-93), and age phase (age range: over 76). The result is the estimated age phase and its age range. This is the example how to operate the PCQDA model. The WholeSurface and Apex files are imported ply file of the scanned auricular surface. Both file can be downloaded though https://github.com/jisunjang19/cran-JSDNE (in data folder). DNE variables (MeanDNE.Apex, TotalDNE.TotalPolygonFaces, Proportion.DNEunder0.0001, Proportion.DNEover0.6) are calcaulted automatically in the PCQDA_result() function. Then, the function is estimated the age phase.The output is the estimated age phase and age range.

```{r}
library(JSDNE)
PCQDA_output <- PCQDA_result(WholeSurface, Apex)
```

#### `PCLR_result()`
PCLR method involves two age phases: age phase 1 (age range: under 67), and age phase 2 (age range: over 63). The result is the estimated age phase and its age range.
This is the example how to operate the PCLR model. The WholeSurface and Apex files are imported ply file of the scanned auricular surface. Both file can be downloaded though https://github.com/jisunjang19/cran-JSDNE (in data folder). DNE variables (TotalDNE.TotalPolygonFaces, MeanDNE.Apex, MeanDNE.Convex, MedianDNE.Whole, IQRDNE.Whole) are calculated automatically in the PCR_result() function. Then, the function is estimated the age phase. The output is the estimated age phase and age range.

```{r}
library(JSDNE)
PCR_output <- PCR_result(WholeSurface, Apex)
```

#### `A_PCR_result()`
A_PCR method estimates the age as the regression analysis. The result is the estimated age and the standard error (9
0yrs).
